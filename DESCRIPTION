Description: Genetic data from Plasmodium parasites can tell us something about the spatial
    connectivity of parasite populations. Infections that trace back to a common ancestor in
    the recent past tend to be highly related, meaning we can use estimates of pairwise
    relatedness between sampling locations to infer levels of gene flow in the population,
    and to identify barriers and corridors of migration. PlasmoMAPI does this in a statistically
    robust way, accounting for the natural fall-off of relatedness with distance to identify
    significant discontinuities in the overall spatial pattern.
